## Q1: Which dataset (please give the filename too) are you using from the downloaded package from the World Bank?

We used dataset from the gender statistics.

## Describe the data.

The data had the female side of the things and the male of the things. The data described age at first marriage between males and females.

## Q2: Complete an analysis to show evidence to confirm or refute the decline in marriage rates for two countries.

### Justify the Variables or Indicator Names that you chose for this analysis. 

The variable we used was 'Age at first marriage, female', and it was a good variable to use. The variable is able to help us understand if there is an increasing or decreasing rate in marriage rates because if people are getting married at an older age, we can assume that males and females are more focused on their careers and are looking for more independence, so they are less likely to get married. This will result in people getting married at an older age, as less younger people are getting married.


### What are the limitations to these variables in terms of addressing the above question? For instance, what part of the above question can these variables address? What parts of the above question can they _not_ address?

Age at first marriage had a lot of limitations as there was not enough data for the US to determine if people are getting married at an older age or not. This means that it is difficult to conclude if the marriage rates for males and females are going down.

### Describe your findings and their conclusions from your analysis.

I would try to confirm the narrowing gender gap


### Justify the Variables or Indicator Names that you chose for this analysis.


Women’s participation rate in the U.S. and the U.K.
We also used the number of female salaried workers.


#### What are the limitations to these variables in terms of addressing the above question?


I do not think the participation rate is a good variable when it comes to addressing the gender wage gap. Moreover, obviously, we have a number of female workers and we could definitely see that their numbers are increasing. However, to critique this their labor participation rate was much lower than men’s. Although we concluded that men had the higher participation rate. We could easily notice that women’s growth had much more growth between 2010 and 2019. It grew from 62% to 64%. However, male-only grew from 80 to 80.3%.

Women’s unemployment rate was slightly higher than the men’s unemployment rate
As more years pass, less women are being unemployed
