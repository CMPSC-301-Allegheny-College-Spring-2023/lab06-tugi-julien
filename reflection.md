## Q1: Which dataset (please give the filename too) are you using from the downloaded package from the World Bank?

We used dataset from the gender statistics.

## Describe the data.

The data had the female side of the things and the male of the things. The data described age at first marriage between malers and females.

## Q2: Complete an analysis to show evidence to confirm or refute the decline in marriage rates for two countries.

### Justify the Variables or Indicator Names that you chose for this analysis. 

The variable we used was 'Age at first marriage, female', and it was a good variable to use. The variable is able to help us understand if there is an increasing or decreasing rate in marriage rates because if people are getting married at an older age, we can assume that males and females are more focused on their careers and are looking for more independence, so they are less likely to get married. This will result in people getting married at an older age, as less younger people are getting married.


### What are the limitations to these variables in terms of addressing the above question? For instance, what part of the above question can these variables address? What parts of the above question can they _not_ address?

Age at first marriage had a lot of limitations as there was not enough data for the US to determine if people are getting married at an older age or not. This means that it is difficult to conclude if the marriage rates for males and females are going down.

### Describe your findings and their conclusions from your analysis.

## Q3: Complete an analysis to show evidence to confirm or refute the narrowing gender wage gap

Our team refutes the idea that there is a narrowing gender wage gap. Our evidence shows that the men’s salary and wage workers in the US are increasing at the same rate as the females. Therefore, the gap between the males and females are neither increasing nor decreasing.

### Justify the Variables or Indicator Names that you chose for this analysis. 

We used the variable Wage and salaried workers, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate) and Wage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) for the US and the UK. These variables were used to see if there is a narrowing gender wage gap or not because it represents the percent of how much the male and females are employed with a wage or salary. This employment between males and females can be impacted by discrimination and education opportunities, which can impact the gender wage gap.

#### What are the limitations to these variables in terms of addressing the above question? 

The limitation with these variables is that employment of wage and salaried workers between males and females in the US and the UK does not fully connect with the gender wage gap. This is because the gender wage gap can be impacted by many other variables, so the employment does not fully determine if there is a gender wage gap or not.

### Describe your findings and their conclusions from your analysis.

Our findings show that because there is no narrowing percentage between male and female wage and salaried workers in the US and UK, we conclude that there is no narrowing gender wage wage between males and females.
